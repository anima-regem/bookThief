# 📚 The Book Thief (Not The Movie, Just A Really Cool App)

Welcome to the most over-engineered way to get book recommendations since your local librarian got replaced by a coffee machine! 

## 🤔 What's This All About?

Ever wished you could tell an AI "I'm feeling like a grumpy cat who enjoys world domination and tea" and get book recommendations? Well, now you can! We've built the perfect app for people who are too lazy to browse Goodreads but still want to pretend they're sophisticated readers.

## ✨ Features That'll Blow Your Mind (or at least mildly entertain you)

- 🌚 Dark mode because we're not monsters who blind users
- 🤖 AI that pretends to understand your existential crisis
- 📱 Works on phones (yes, even that ancient iPhone you refuse to upgrade)
- 🎭 Understands your mood swings better than your therapist
- 🎨 Pretty animations because we spent way too much time on CSS

## 🏃‍♂️ Get This Party Started

1. Clone this bad boy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-cool-username/book-thief.git
```
in the offchace you forked this thing, else:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anima-regem/book-thief.git
```

2. Install stuff:
```bash
npm install # This is where you pray to the npm gods
```

3. Create a `.env` file and add your super secret stuff:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=pinky-promise-not-to-share
```

4. Fire it up:
```bash
npm run dev # Cross your fingers
```

## 🎮 How to Use This Masterpiece

1. Type something about yourself in the fancy text box
2. Click the mysterious "Generate" button
3. ✨ MAGIC HAPPENS ✨
4. Get books that may or may not change your life

Example input: "I am a procrastinating developer who drinks too much coffee and talks to rubber ducks"

## 🐛 When Things Go Wrong (and they will)

If the app breaks, try these time-tested solutions:
1. Turn it off and on again
2. Blame your internet connection
3. Clear your cache (does anyone know what this actually does?)
4. Sacrifice a rubber duck to the coding gods
5. Contact us (please don't)
